In today's fast-paced world, there is a growing demand for more efficient ways to accomplish daily tasks. Over the past decades, we have witnessed a digital transformation in healthcare. This project embodies the
concept of an engaging online report. Getting the results of your tests online would be more convenient. Reports can be efficiently updated based on the patient's provided credentials.
The platform enables users to utilize the saved information. Access the lab test results effortlessly with your user credentials. The process would reduce the task of standing in the queues waiting for your turn.
The entire platform is more sophisticated and systematic to use. Our objective is to revolutionize how pathology reports are accessed and managed, providing a reliable and advanced solution that enhances the 
healthcare experience for all parties involved.
Utilization of AWS:
Gone are the days when companies grappled with significant losses while building tech teams and making investments in storage. They needed to rely on multiple hard drives, leading to increased expenses. 
Therefore, to address this challenge, cloud computing was designed.The AWS platforms deliver a wide range of services. It is a broadly used cloud platform. Dealing with high traffic can be challenging, but with 
the help of AWS's DynamoDB, we can effectively handle and manage it.
AWS's DynamoDB is an easy-access platform that controls high traffic. It helps in rapid growth. It is a managed NoSQL database optimized for performance at scale. It will provide a primary key to find the 
corresponding values. One of the main features involves high availability and durability. It is a pay-as-you-go model.

How does this work?
The project involves the usage of MERN stack development. React.js is used for the front end, and node.js for the back end.Let us explore the front page of the platform.It consists of 3 header options at the top 
right-most corner. It includes - Create New, Report, and Add test.
In Create New, One can input the credentials and other details and click the Submit button. The examined and submitted date is to be provided by the user. One can clear the form if something is inaccurately
input with the Clear button.
The Reports tab consists of two sections: Pending and Completed. It simply puts all the pending test reports in the Pending section and the Completed reports in the Completed section. If one needs to update 
the patient's details, they can click the icon on the left to the delete icon. It would open an Update Patient page as follows.
Now, to add tests to a particular pathology test, click on the icon on the right to the delete icon. Now, by clicking on provides you with a preview of the report to be printed. Letâ€™s take the first example and
develop a preview of the same. Here, one can Add and Remove tests as needed. The report gets generated when clicked on the Reports button.The Add Test tab opens up a pop-up as follows. Here, one can input the
details related to the test along with the biological reference values.

A standard pathology report generally includes patient details such as name, identification number, and relevant medical history. It has the type, source of the specimen, and details of the collection and handling
of the specimen. The report also has the name and degree of the referring doctor and the pathologist in charge.One can search for the tests and then select accordingly. Biological reference values are set by 
default on the test results. These are the minimum or the maximum values. The report would consist of the reporting details, test methods, and instruments used. The process of extracting this information is 
labor-intensive and error-prone. This task is made easy with online report technology.
